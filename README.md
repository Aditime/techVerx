# techVerx

This is an ongoing project. I am developing a technical diary to document my journey as I learn new skills in software engineering and data science.  
This is the first part of the project. This part creates, updates and deletes posts. I have used React in the front-end and MondoDB in the back-end. 

I will add google authentication in the next part of the project. Stay tuned :)
